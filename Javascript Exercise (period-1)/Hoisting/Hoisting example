Hoisting is examply when a var is hoisted to the top, when used internally in a function and then gives undefined value, because it has not yet been intialised. This can give problems and must be taken into consideration.

example:

var greeting = "hej"

console.log(greeting);

var sayHello = function(){
   var greeting = "hello"
   console.log(greeting);
}

sayHello();


Output:

hej

undefined
